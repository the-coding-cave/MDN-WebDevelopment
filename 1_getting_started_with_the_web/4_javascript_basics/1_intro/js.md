# Javascript
JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum effort. These include:

* Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) — APIs built into web browsers, providing functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.

* Third-party APIs — Allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.

* Third-party frameworks and libraries — You can apply these to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications.
