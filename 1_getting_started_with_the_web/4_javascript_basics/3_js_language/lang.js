// SOME OF THE CORE FEATURES OF THE JavaScript LANGUAGE

/* Note that these features are common to alll programming laguages, so if you master
these fundamentals, you're well on your way to being able to program just about anything
*/

// Variables

/* Variables are containers that you can store values in. 
   You start by declaring a variable with the var keyword, followed 
   by any name you want to call the variable */

//Ex: 
 var myVariable; 

 
   /* After declaring a variable, you can give a value: */
   
myVariable = "Bob";

/* The above operation could have also be done on the same line 
var myVariable = 'Bob';
*/

/* You can retrive the value the value by just calling the variable by name: */
 
myVariable;

/* After giving a variable a value, you can later choose to change it :
*/

myVariable = 'Steve';


//DATA TYPES 
/* Variables may hold values that have different data types */

/*Note: Everything in Javascript is an object and can be stored in a variable */

var myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
