var myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');

/* First we grabbed a reference to the heading (the h1) using a built in function called querySelector().
   Secondly, we stored this reference in a variable called myHeading.
   
   Lastly, we set the value of the myHeading variable's textContent property (which represents the content 
   of the heading) to "Hello world!"*/
